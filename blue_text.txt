Your battalions will be able to move from one territory to 
another as long as the territories are adjacent. Territories are 
adjacent if they share a border, or a sea-line connects them 
across water.
EXAMPLE: 
 
The territory of Minhiriath is 
adjacent to South Downs because 
they share a border, and to 
Enedwaith and Dunland because 
bridges allow passage across the 
separating river. Minhiriath is also 
adjacent to Mithlond, Belfalas and 
Umbar because sea-lines connect 
them across the ocean. Battalions in 
Minhiriath can attack any of these 
adjacent territories. But beware, the 
battalions in Minhiriath can also BE 
attacked from any of these 
territories. Minhiriath is not 
adjacent to Harlindon or the Shire 
because a river separates them and 
there are no bridges to pass over. 
INTRODUCTION
Many, many years ago, The One Ring was forged by the Dark 
Lord Sauron to control all of Middle-earth. Naturally, its awesome 
strength is much desired by those who wish for power. For a long 
time, its whereabouts remained secret, but recently its power has 
been sensed again in the land of its creation. The forces of evil are 
mounting a ferocious hunt to find The One Ring, while those of a 
gentler nature are keen to keep it from their reach. 
This special edition of RISK allows you to decide the fate of the 
people of Middle-earth. You will play either a good force or an 
evil force trying to gain control of the land. Muster your forces 
to battle to ensure that Middle-earth falls into the right hands.
You may also choose to use the RISK: The Lord of the Rings 
Edition gameboard to play standard RISK, by leaving out the 
special elements.
The following rules are for the individual player game. There are 
additional versions explained in the back of this rulebook.
A LOOK AT THE STUFF  
IN THE GAME
First, take all of the game pieces and set them out where you can 
see them. As you read these rules, look at these pieces so you 
know how they all work.
LET’S START WITH THE GAMEBOARD… 
There it is – Middle-earth, just waiting for you to conquer it. The 
gameboard is divided into 64 territories, each with its own name.
In the lower left corner of the gameboard, there is a 
battleground. This is where your battles will take place. 
We will discuss this in more detail soon.
 
NOW LET’S LOOK AT THE  
PLASTIC PIECES…
There are 4 armies in this game, each a different color. Each 
player will be a different colored army. 
If you look at the pieces closely, you’ll see that there are 6 
different shapes: 3 for good and 3 for evil. All of these pieces 
represent your battalions, but each one represents a different 
number of battalions. They are:
FORCES OF GOOD
FORCES OF EVIL
During the game, you will have many pieces on the board, 
sometimes many in one territory. When this happens, use a larger 
piece to save space. It’s a lot easier to have 2 Eagles on the board 
instead of 10 Elven Archers (both equal 10 battalions). Just like 
it’s easier to carry 2 nickels instead of 10 pennies, it’s easier to 
move 2 Cavetrolls instead of 10 Orcs. 
EXAMPLE: 
In Minhiriath, Green has 1 Rider of Rohan and 2 
Elven Archers. Since a Rider of Rohan represents 3 battalions and an 
Elven Archer represents 1 battalion, the Green player has 5 battalions in 
Minhiriath (3+1+1). The Red player has 1 Cavetroll, 1 Dark Rider and  
1 Orc in Enedwaith. This represents 9 battalions (5+3+1).
THE DICE
Use the dice when attacking and defending territories.  
The 3 red dice are used when attacking. The 2 black dice  
are used when defending.

territory CardS
There is 1 Territory card for each of the 64 territories on the 
board. 
 There are also 2 wild 
cards that don’t have territories or good/evil symbols on them 
but do have pictures of the 3 battalion types.
Territory cards are used to determine positions at the start of 
the game, and bonus reinforcements throughout the game. We’ll 
explain how they work a little later.
GETTING STARTED
1.  Set out the gameboard so everyone can reach it.
MISSION CARD
EVENT CARD
POWER CARD
4.  Each player chooses a color and takes all of the battalions of 
that color. Place your battalions in a pile near you. 
Now get out your starting battalions. These battalions will be 
placed on the board before play begins. The number of starting 
battalions depends on the number of players.

Count out your starting battalions from your battalion pile, 
and put them in front of you. 
CLAIMING TERRITORIES
Now, each player rolls 1 die to see who goes first – the high die 
roll wins. Play then passes to the left.
To claim an additional territory, take one of your starting 
battalions and place it into an empty territory. You now control 
this territory. The next player places a battalion into an empty 
territory, claiming that territory, and so on. You cannot put a 
battalion into a territory that has already been claimed.
Eventually, all 64 territories will be claimed. Some players may 
control one more territory than the other players.  This is OK.

i
MPortant
:
 From now on, there will be no unclaimed territories 
on the board. Control of a territory (the player who has 
battalions there) may change, but a territory will never be 
unclaimed.
REINFORCING TERRITORIES
Now that all of the territories are claimed, you will start 
reinforcing your territories. The more battalions you have in a 
territory, the easier it is to attack and defend from.  
Reinforcing a territory is simple: just place one of your starting 
battalions into a territory that you control. You cannot place 
reinforcements into an enemy’s territory. After you place your 
reinforcement, the player to your left reinforces one territory, then 
the next player to the left, and so on. Keep going around the table 
until all of each player’s starting battalions have been placed.
There is no limit to the number of battalions that can be in a 
territory. You can choose to reinforce one territory with a large 
number of battalions or you can spread your battalions out 
across all of your territories. 
Now it’s time to declare war. Each player rolls 1 die to see who 
starts the game. Note: The player who placed his/her battalions 
first may or may not be the player who takes the first turn.
YOUR TURN
OVERVIEW
At the start of each one of your turns, you will receive 
additional battalions, which you will place on the board to 
reinforce your army. Then you will be able to attack your 
enemies, if you want. After you are done with combat, you 
will get one chance to relocate some of your battalions. If you 
conquer a territory on your turn, you get to draw a Territory 
card. 
That’s all there is to a turn. Now let’s go over things in more 
detail so you can plan your conquest. 
THE 7 STEPS OF YOUR TURN
You must do these steps in order.
1. Receive and place reinforcements (always).
2. Combat (if you like).
3. Fortify your position (if you like).
4.  Collect a territory card (as long as you have conquered  
a territory).

At the start of your turn, you get additional battalions to 
reinforce your territories. How many reinforcements you get 
depends on
, the number 
of territories you control, the number of regions you control (if 
any), and any Territory card sets you turn in.

:
 Now count the number of territories 
you control (these are the territories with your battalions in 
them). Take your total number of territories and divide them by 
3 (ignore any remainders). This is the number of reinforcements 
you receive. However, the number of reinforcements you receive 
can NEVER be fewer than 3, so even if you control only a few 
territories, you’ll always receive at least 3 reinforcements.  
Take your reinforcements from your battalion pile and put them 
in front of you. This is the start of your "reinforcement pile."
Look at the list below to help you determine your reinforcements.

 You also get reinforcements for 
every region you control. Remember that a region is a group 
of territories of the same color. If you control every territory 
within the region, then you control the region. 
The number of reinforcements you receive depends on  
which region (or regions) you control (if any). The chart 
on the left side of the gameboard shows how many 
reinforcements you receive for each region. Count out these 
reinforcements from your battalion pile and add them to the 
reinforcement pile in front of you (the pile you started by 
counting your territories).

 This may seem a little 
out of place because we haven’t talked about how you get 
Territory cards yet (we’ll talk about that more in Step 4), but 
this is the time when you would turn in Territory cards for 
bonus reinforcements.
Remember how each Territory card has an image at the bottom 
– an Elven Archer, a Dark Rider or an Eagle (the wild cards have 
all 3)? When you have a set of 3 cards that show either the 
same picture or one of each picture, you can turn them in for 
reinforcements. If you have a wild card, it can count as any one of 
the 3 – an Elven Archer, a Dark Rider or an Eagle.

oMbat
Combat is the main part of your turn. It is here that you attack 
your opponents and attempt to take territories from them. You 
can choose how many times you want to attack, in what order, 
and when to call it off. You can choose not to attack at all (if so, 
skip to Step 3) or to attack until you have almost no battalions 
left. You can even attack more than one territory on your turn.

Here are some terms used during combat:
* The 
attaCker
 is the player whose turn it currently is.
* The 
defender
 is the player being attacked.
* An
 
invaSion
 is when a territory is being attacked. The 
invasion lasts until either the territory is taken over or 
until the attacker calls off the invasion. You may be able 
to invade more than one territory on your turn.
* A 
battle
 is one roll of the dice (for each, the attacker and 
defender) during an invasion. An invasion may require 
one battle or it may require dozens of battles.

 C
an

You can invade from any one territory you control into an 
adjacent enemy’s territory. 
 You can only invade an 
enemy’s territories – not your own. Choose a territory you 
control and announce the adjacent territory you wish to invade.

attle
You must have at least 2 battalions in a territory in order to 
attack. This is because 1 battalion must stay behind in order to 
protect the territory you are invading from. This battalion must 
be set aside and cannot be part of any battle. 
Now choose how many battalions you will send from your 
attacking territory into the battle. You can send 1, 2 or 3 
battalions. Your invasion force may be much larger than 3, 
but no more than 3 battalions can be sent into each battle. 
Take your attacking battalions and place them on the 
attacker’s spaces on the battleground (in the lower left 
corner of the gameboard).
Next, the defender chooses how many battalions will defend 
from the attacked territory. You can defend with either 1 or 2 
battalions. There may be more battalions in the territory, but 2 is 
the maximum number of battalions you can defend with during 
a battle. You will continue defending the attacked territory until 
either your last battalion is defeated or your opponent calls off 
the invasion. 
Take your defending battalions and place them on the defender’s 
spaces on the battleground.
Let the battle begin… Each side rolls 1 die for each battalion 
attacking or defending. This means the attacker will roll 1, 2 or 3 
dice and the defender will roll 1 or 2 dice. 
r
eSolving
 
the
 b
attle
After both sides roll the dice, put your dice in order from 
highest to lowest. You will then compare your highest die to 
your opponent’s highest die to see who won. IMPORTANT: In 
case of a tie roll, the DEFENDER wins. 
The player with the highest die roll wins. The loser removes 
a battalion from the battleground. This battalion has been 
defeated. Put the defeated battalion back into its respective 
battalion pile off the board. 
After you and your opponent compare the highest dice, 
compare the next-highest dice. 
If there is no die to compare yours to, meaning you rolled 1 or 2 
more dice than your opponent, then ignore those dice rolls.
When the battle is over, all remaining battalions return to their 
respective territories – but don’t worry, you may send them back 
into battle immediately.

After any battle, you (the attacker) may choose to call off the

In between battles, you can change the territory from which you 
are invading and continue the invasion from a different, adjacent 
territory. What you cannot do is battle with battalions from 
different territories at the same time. During one battle, all of 
your battalions must be from the same territory.

You win the invasion when you defeat the last defending 
battalion from a territory. Take the battalions used to win the 
battle and move them from the battleground into the territory 
you invaded. You may now move any additional battalions from 
your invading territory in to join them. So even though you can 
only battle with 3 battalions, once you’ve won the invasion, you 
can move more troops into your new territory. However, you 
must do this before you declare a new invasion.

You eliminate another player if you defeat his/her last 
battalion on the board. This player is now out of the game. As a 
reward, you get all of that player’s Territory cards (if he/she has 
any). Add these Territory cards to your hand. 
 
If your new hand of Territory cards is now 5 or more, you must 
stop and immediately turn a set in for bonus reinforcements. You 
place these reinforcements into any of your territories. If you 
still have 5 or more cards, then turn in another set and place 
these reinforcements as well. Finally, when you have 4 or fewer 
cards, continue your turn.

oSition
After you are finished with combat (and it is your choice when 
you are done), you get ONE fortification (or "free move") with 
your battalions. 
To fortify your position, take as many battalions as you’d 
like from one of your territories and move them to another 
connected territory. (Remember: You MUST leave at least one 
battalion behind  -- you cannot abandon a territory.) 
Territories are "connected" if all the territories in between 
are also CONTROLLED BY YOU. You cannot pass through 
territories controlled by another player.  
Fortification is not an attack; it is simply a movement from one 
of your territories to another in order to protect your front line 
or to get into position for your next turn.

At the end of your turn, you may be able to collect a 
Territory card. 
If you conquered at least 1 territory on your turn, then you 
get 1 Territory card. Draw it off the top of the deck and add 
it to your hand. It doesn’t matter whether you conquered 1 
territory or 40 territories, you only get 1 Territory card. If 
you didn’t conquer any territories on your turn, then you 
do not get a Territory card.

FINDING THE RING
There is one extra step to your turn. This is where the evil player 
may try to find The One Ring.
THE 8 STEPS TO YOUR TURN
1. Receive and place Reinforcements (always)
2. Combat (If you like)
3. Fortify your position (if you like)
4. Collect a Territory card (as long as you have conquered a 
territory)
5. Collect an Adventrue card (as long as your Leader has 
conquered a territory that has a Site of Power within it)
6. Replace a Leader (if you have none on the board)
7. Try to find The One Ring (only if The One Ring is in a 
territory controlled by an evil player)
8. Move the Fellowship

Just before moving the Fellowship, check to see if The One Ring is 
in a territory controlled by evil. If so, the evil player who controls 
the territory rolls 2 dice (it doesn’t matter which color).
* 
If that evil player controls the entire region, add 1 to the dice roll.
* 
If that evil player’s Leader is in the territory, add 1 to the dice roll.
* 
If that evil player controls the entire region, and has a Leader 
present, add 2 to the dice roll.
If the total of the dice roll plus any bonuses added is 12 or higher, 
The One Ring is found and evil instantly wins.
