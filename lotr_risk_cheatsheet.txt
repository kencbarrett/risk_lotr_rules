EXAMPLE:
North Mirkwood, Carrock, 
Eastern Mirkwood, Anduin 
Valley and South Mirkwood 
are territories. Together, these 
5 territories make up the 
region of Mirkwood.
THE FIRST TIME 
YOU PLAY:
1.   Punch out the card
trays from the 
cardboard frame.
2.  Fold in the sides of each
tray and insert them 
into the two openings in 
the game box as shown:
These territories are grouped into 9 regions, each a

Your battalions will be able to move from one territory to 
another as long as the territories are adjacent. Territories are 
adjacent if they share a border, or a sea-line connects them 
across water. However, mountains and rivers are impassable. 
Therefore, territories separated by mountains are not adjacent; 
nor are territories separated by a river, if there is no bridge 
between the territories allowing passage.
EXAMPLE:
The territory of Minhiriath is 
adjacent to South Downs because 
they share a border, and to 
Enedwaith and Dunland because 
bridges allow passage across the 
separating river. Minhiriath is also 
adjacent to Mithlond, Belfalas and 
Umbar because sea-lines connect 
them across the ocean. Battalions in 
Minhiriath can attack any of these 
adjacent territories. But beware, the 
battalions in Minhiriath can also BE 
attacked from any of these 
territories. Minhiriath is not 
adjacent to Harlindon or the Shire 
because a river separates them and 
there are no bridges to pass over.
INTRODUCTION
Many, many years ago, The One Ring was forged by the Dark 
Lord Sauron to control all of Middle-earth. Naturally, its awesome 
strength is much desired by those who wish for power. For a long 
time, its whereabouts remained secret, but recently its power has 
been sensed again in the land of its creation. The forces of evil are 
mounting a ferocious hunt to find The One Ring, while those of a 
gentler nature are keen to keep it from their reach.
This special edition of RISK allows you to decide the fate of the 
people of Middle-earth. You will play either a good force or an 
evil force trying to gain control of the land. Muster your forces 
to battle to ensure that Middle-earth falls into the right hands.
You may also choose to use the RISK: The Lord of the Rings 
Edition gameboard to play standard RISK, by leaving out the 
special elements.
The following rules are for the individual player game. There are 
additional versions explained in the back of this rulebook.
If you are familiar with the standard game of RISK, you only need 
to read the section of rules in BLUE. These are the differences 
between standard RISK and RISK: The Lord of the Rings Edition.
OBJECT
To score as many points as possible before the Fellowship, with 
The One Ring, reaches Mount Doom. Score points for each 
Territory you occupy and each Region you control, as well as for 
cards played and Strongholds held.
A LOOK AT THE STUFF  
IN THE GAME
First, take all of the game pieces and set them out where you can 
see them. As you read these rules, look at these pieces so you 
know how they all work.
LET’S START WITH THE GAMEBOARD…
There it is – Middle-earth, just waiting for you to conquer it. The 
gameboard is divided into 64 territories, each with its own name.
CONTENTS
•  1 Gold-Tone Ring
• 4 Armies
•  126 Cards
(64 Territory Cards,  
2 Wild Cards,  
60 Adventure Cards)
•  3 Red Dice
•  2 Black Dice
•  Gameboard

In the lower left corner of the gameboard, there is a 
battleground. This is where your battles will take place. 
We will discuss this in more detail soon.
OTHER FEATURES
Some of the territories in Middle-earth have special sites that 
come into play:
StrongholdS: These are counted as part of, not in addition to, 
the territory they are in. Battalions defending a territory with 
a Stronghold add 1 to their higher defensive die roll. See the 
Strongholds to the left.
SiteS of Power: These are counted as part of, not in addition to, 
the territory they are in. Using a Leader to conquer a territory 
with a Site of Power allows you to draw an Adventure card at the 
end of your turn. Some Adventure cards can only be turned in 
after you’ve moved a Leader to a Site of Power. See the Sites of 
Power on page 5.
the Path of the fellowShiP: This dotted line passes through 
18 territories from the Shire to Mount Doom. At the end of 
most turns, the Fellowship (represented by The One Ring) 
moves one territory along the path. The game ends when the 
Fellowship reaches Mount Doom. See a portion of the Path of 
the Fellowship below.
NOW LET’S LOOK AT THE  
PLASTIC PIECES…
There are 4 armies in this game, each a different color. Each 
player will be a different colored army.
If you look at the pieces closely, you’ll see that there are 6 
different shapes: 3 for good and 3 for evil. All of these pieces
represent your battalions, but each one represents a different 
number of battalions. They are:
FORCES OF GOOD
FORCES OF EVIL
During the game, you will have many pieces on the board, 
sometimes many in one territory. When this happens, use a larger 
piece to save space. It’s a lot easier to have 2 Eagles on the board 
instead of 10 Elven Archers (both equal 10 battalions). Just like 
it’s easier to carry 2 nickels instead of 10 pennies, it’s easier to 
move 2 Cavetrolls instead of 10 Orcs.
EXAMPLE: In Minhiriath, Green has 1 Rider of Rohan and 2 
Elven Archers. Since a Rider of Rohan represents 3 battalions and an 
Elven Archer represents 1 battalion, the Green player has 5 battalions in 
Minhiriath (3+1+1). The Red player has 1 Cavetroll, 1 Dark Rider and  
1 Orc in Enedwaith. This represents 9 battalions (5+3+1).
You also have 2 pieces that look  
like shields. These are your Leaders.  
Leaders give you combat bonuses and  
also allow you to draw (and, in some  
cases, play) Adventure cards.
THE DICE
Use the dice when attacking and defending territories.  
The 3 red dice are used when attacking. The 2 black dice  
are used when defending.

There are 2 types of cards: Territory cards and Adventure cards.

territory CardS
There is 1 Territory card for each of the 64 territories on the 
board. Each of these has the name and picture of a territory, a 
picture of a piece from the game (an Elven Archer, a Dark Rider 
or an Eagle), and—possibly—a symbol marking that territory as 
good or evil (a good shield or an evil shield). There are also 2 wild 
cards that don’t have territories or good/evil symbols on them 
but do have pictures of the 3 battalion types.
Territory cards are used to determine positions at the start of 
the game, and bonus reinforcements throughout the game. We’ll 
explain how they work a little later.
adventure CardS
There are 3 types of 
Adventure cards:
MiSSion CardS 
These cards contain secret 
missions for your Leaders.
event CardS 
These cards may help or 
hinder your quest with 
events that occur when  
you play them.
Power CardS  
Power cards can make a big 
difference to your strategy.
GETTING STARTED
1.  Set out the gameboard so everyone can reach it.
2.  Separate the cards into Territory cards and Adventure cards.
3.  Remove the 2 wild cards from the Territory card deck and
set them aside for now. Then separate the remaining 
Territory cards into good, evil and neutral decks. The 
good Territory cards have this symbol on them; the
evil Territory cards have this symbol on 
them; and the neutral Territory cards have 
no symbol on them. Shuffle each deck 
separately and place them facedown next 
to the gameboard.
TERRITORY CARDS
WILD CARD
This is a wild card. It has 
no territory or good/evil
symbol on it but it does
have pictures of the 3
battalion types.
This Territory card is for the 
Shire. It has a picture of that
territory as well as a Dark 
Rider and a shield for the
good army.
MISSION CARD
EVENT CARD
POWER CARD
4.  Each player chooses a color and takes all of the battalions of
that color. Place your battalions in a pile near you. The yellow 
and green pieces represent the good armies, while the black 
and red ones represent the evil armies.
*  In a 3-player game, one player will control a good army while
the remaining two players control the two evil armies.
Now get out your starting battalions. These battalions will be 
placed on the board before play begins. The number of starting 
battalions depends on the number of players.

Starting battalionS
2 PlayerS 
60 eaCh (See 2-Player ruleS on Page 18.)
3 PlayerS 
52 eaCh
4 PlayerS 
45 eaCh
Count out your starting battalions from your battalion pile, 
and put them in front of you. Also take your 2 Leaders and add 
these to your starting battalions.
CLAIMING TERRITORIES
Players are randomly given some starting territories by dealing 
out cards from the Territory card decks. In a 4-player game, divide 
the good Territory card deck in half and give 8 cards to each of 
the good players. Then divide the evil Territory card deck in half 
and give 8 cards to each of the evil players. (In a 3-player game, 
give all 16 good Territory cards to the good player. Then divide 
the evil Territory card deck in half, giving each of the evil players 
8 evil Territory cards, as well as 8 cards each from the neutral 
Territory card deck.) Players should place one battalion in each 
of the territories shown on their cards. Then put all the Territory 
cards together, including the wild cards, and reshuffle them back 
into one deck, which is placed facedown near the gameboard.
Now, each player rolls 1 die to see who goes first – the high die 
roll wins. Play then passes to the left.
To claim an additional territory, take one of your starting 
battalions and place it into an empty territory. You now control 
this territory. The next player places a battalion into an empty 
territory, claiming that territory, and so on. You cannot put a 
battalion into a territory that has already been claimed.
Eventually, all 64 territories will be claimed. Some players may 
control one more territory than the other players.  This is OK.

iMPortant: From now on, there will be no unclaimed territories 
on the board. Control of a territory (the player who has 
battalions there) may change, but a territory will never be 
unclaimed.
REINFORCING TERRITORIES
Now that all of the territories are claimed, you will start 
reinforcing your territories. The more battalions you have in a 
territory, the easier it is to attack and defend from.
Reinforcing a territory is simple: just place one of your starting 
battalions into a territory that you control. You cannot place 
reinforcements into an enemy’s territory. After you place your 
reinforcement, the player to your left reinforces one territory, then 
the next player to the left, and so on. Keep going around the table 
until all of each player’s starting battalions have been placed.
There is no limit to the number of battalions that can be in a 
territory. You can choose to reinforce one territory with a large 
number of battalions or you can spread your battalions out 
across all of your territories.
PLACING LEADERS
After all battalions are on the board, place 1 Leader on the board 
in a territory you control.  After everyone has placed 1 Leader, 
place your second Leader in turn order. You CANNOT place 2 
Leaders in the same territory.
TERRITORY CARDS
Deal 1 Territory card, facedown, to each player. This makes it 
easier to create territory sets early in the game.
ADVENTURE CARDS
Remove the Event cards (the ones that read "Play Immediately") 
from the Adventure card deck and set these aside. Then deal 4 
Adventure cards, facedown, to each player.
Return the Event cards to the Adventure card deck, shuffle, 
and place it facedown next to the gameboard.
THE ONE RING
Place The One Ring in the Shire. This is where the Fellowship 
begins its journey. From now on The One Ring will represent 
the Fellowship.
Now it’s time to declare war. Each player rolls 1 die to see who 
starts the game. Note: The player who placed his/her battalions 
first may or may not be the player who takes the first turn.
YOUR TURN
OVERVIEW
At the start of each one of your turns, you will receive 
additional battalions, which you will place on the board to 
reinforce your army. Then you will be able to attack your 
enemies, if you want. After you are done with combat, you 
will get one chance to relocate some of your battalions. If you 
conquer a territory on your turn, you get to draw a Territory 
card. Also, if your Leader conquers a territory that had a Site of 
Power within it, you’ll get to draw an Adventure card. At the end 
of your turn, you will move The One Ring forward 1 territory 
along the Fellowship’s path.
That’s all there is to a turn. Now let’s go over things in more 
detail so you can plan your conquest.
THE 7 STEPS OF YOUR TURN
You must do these steps in order.
1. Receive and place reinforcements (always).
2. Combat (if you like).
3. Fortify your position (if you like).
4.  Collect a territory card (as long as you have conquered
a territory).
5.  Collect an adventure card (as long as your Leader has
conquered a territory that has a Site of Power within it).
6. Replace a leader (if you have none on the board).
7. Move the fellowship.
SteP 1: reCeive and PlaCe reinforCeMentS
At the start of your turn, you get additional battalions to 
reinforce your territories. How many reinforcements you get 
depends on the number of strongholds you control, the number 
of territories you control, the number of regions you control (if 
any), and any Territory card sets you turn in.
reinforCe your StrongholdS: The first thing you do is place 1 
battalion into each territory with a stronghold that you control.
Count your territorieS: Now count the number of territories 
you control (these are the territories with your battalions in 
them). Take your total number of territories and divide them by 
3 (ignore any remainders). This is the number of reinforcements 
you receive. However, the number of reinforcements you receive 
can NEVER be fewer than 3, so even if you control only a few 
territories, you’ll always receive at least 3 reinforcements.

Take your reinforcements from your battalion pile and put them 
in front of you. This is the start of your "reinforcement pile."

do you Control any regionS? You also get reinforcements for 
every region you control. Remember that a region is a group 
of territories of the same color. If you control every territory 
within the region, then you control the region.
The number of reinforcements you receive depends on  
which region (or regions) you control (if any). The chart 
on the left side of the gameboard shows how many 
reinforcements you receive for each region. Count out these 
reinforcements from your battalion pile and add them to the 
reinforcement pile in front of you (the pile you started by 
counting your territories).
turn in any Card SetS you May have: This may seem a little 
out of place because we haven’t talked about how you get 
Territory cards yet (we’ll talk about that more in Step 4), but 
this is the time when you would turn in Territory cards for 
bonus reinforcements.
EXAMPLE:
Green controls 13 territories 
at the start of his turn. 13 
divided by 3 is 4. 
(Remember: You ignore the 
remainder). Green gets 4 
reinforcements.
Red controls 5 territories at 
the start of her turn. 5 
divided by 3 is 1. However, 
you can never receive fewer 
than 3 reinforcements, 
so Red gets 3.
EXAMPLE:
Red controls Mirkwood.  
In addition to the 
reinforcements she received 
for controlling her 
territories, Red also gets  
4 reinforcements for 
controlling Mirkwood.
Black controls Rhovanion 
and Mordor. In addition to 
the reinforcements he 
received for controlling his 
territories, Black receives 7 
reinforcements (5 for 
Rhovanion and 2 for 
Mordor) for controlling 
these 2 regions.
Remember how each Territory card has an image at the bottom 
– an Elven Archer, a Dark Rider or an Eagle (the wild cards have 
all 3)? When you have a set of 3 cards that show either the 
same picture or one of each picture, you can turn them in for 
reinforcements. If you have a wild card, it can count as any one of 
the 3 – an Elven Archer, a Dark Rider or an Eagle.
The number of reinforcements you get for turning in cards 
depends on what type of set you turn in. Look at the chart 
below to determine how many reinforcements you’ll get for a 
card set, then add these bonus battalions to your reinforcement 
pile and discard your card set.
you Can turn in CardS when you have
one of the following:
SET 
 BONUS BATTALIONS
3 Elven Archers 
4
 3 Dark Riders 
6
 3 Eagles 
8
 1  Elven Archer, 1 Dark Rider,   
10 
and 1 Eagle
reMeMber: A wild card can be used for any one of the  
above cards.
iMPortant: When you have 5 or more cards, you must turn  
in a set as you will always have at least one of the above.
now it’S tiMe to PlaCe your reinforCeMentS: After gathering 
your reinforcements, place ALL of them into territories that 
you control. You can choose to put all of your reinforcements 
into one territory or spread them out across your territories. 
Remember: You must place ALL of these reinforcements.
SteP 2: CoMbat
Combat is the main part of your turn. It is here that you attack 
your opponents and attempt to take territories from them. You 
can choose how many times you want to attack, in what order, 
and when to call it off. You can choose not to attack at all (if so, 
skip to Step 3) or to attack until you have almost no battalions 
left. You can even attack more than one territory on your turn.
EXAMPLE:
Red has 4 cards at the start 
of her turn. They show 2 
Elven Archers, a Dark Rider, 
and an Eagle. She turns in a 
3-card set: an Elven Archer, a 
Dark Rider, and an Eagle and 
receives 10 bonus battalions, 
which she adds to her 
reinforcement pile.

a few wordS about CoMbat
Here are some terms used during combat:
* The attaCker is the player whose turn it currently is.
* The defender is the player being attacked.
* An invaSion is when a territory is being attacked. The
invasion lasts until either the territory is taken over or 
until the attacker calls off the invasion. You may be able 
to invade more than one territory on your turn.
* A battle is one roll of the dice (for each, the attacker and
defender) during an invasion. An invasion may require 
one battle or it may require dozens of battles.
where Can i invade?
You can invade from any one territory you control into an 
adjacent enemy’s territory. (If you need a refresher on what makes 
territories adjacent, refer back to page 3.) You can only invade an 
enemy’s territories – not your own. Choose a territory you 
control and announce the adjacent territory you wish to invade.
leaderS 
Leaders have properties of strength in both attack and defense; 
however, they do not represent a battalion in their own right. 
Leaders must move with a battalion.
how you battle
You must have at least 2 battalions in a territory in order to 
attack. This is because 1 battalion must stay behind in order to 
protect the territory you are invading from. This battalion must 
be set aside and cannot be part of any battle.
Now choose how many battalions you will send from your 
attacking territory into the battle. You can send 1, 2 or 3 
battalions. Your invasion force may be much larger than 3, 
but no more than 3 battalions can be sent into each battle.
Take your attacking battalions and place them on the 
attacker’s spaces on the battleground (in the lower left 
corner of the gameboard).
COMBAT 
EXAMPLE:
YELLOW DECLARES 
INVASION
Yellow has 3 battalions in 
Evendim Hills and wants to 
invade Borderlands. For his 
first battle, he can send 2 
battalions into Borderlands. 
He cannot send all 3 since 
one battalion must be held 
back to protect Evendim 
Hills.
RED DEFENDS
Red is defending Borderlands 
and has 3 battalions plus a 
Leader. She can only send 2 
out to defend during battle. 
She sends out 2 battalions 
and her Leader.
LEADER
If your Leader is present in the attacking territory, you may also 
move him to the battleground. If you do so, you will gain a +1 
bonus to your highest attack die.
Next, the defender chooses how many battalions will defend 
from the attacked territory. You can defend with either 1 or 2 
battalions. There may be more battalions in the territory, but 2 is 
the maximum number of battalions you can defend with during 
a battle. You will continue defending the attacked territory until 
either your last battalion is defeated or your opponent calls off 
the invasion.
Take your defending battalions and place them on the defender’s 
spaces on the battleground.
leader & Stronghold 
If your Leader is present in the defending territory, you may 
also move him to the battleground. If you do so, you will 
gain a +1 bonus to your higher defense die. If the defending 
territory contains a stronghold, you automatically gain a +1 
bonus to your higher die. If both a Leader and a stronghold are 
defending, the bonus becomes +2 to the higher die.
Let the battle begin… Each side rolls 1 die for each battalion 
attacking or defending. This means the attacker will roll 1, 2 or 3 
dice and the defender will roll 1 or 2 dice.
reSolving the battle
After both sides roll the dice, put your dice in order from 
highest to lowest. You will then compare your highest die to 
your opponent’s highest die to see who won. IMPORTANT: In 
case of a tie roll, the DEFENDER wins.
The player with the highest die roll wins. The loser removes 
a battalion from the battleground. This battalion has been 
defeated. Put the defeated battalion back into its respective 
battalion pile off the board.
COMBAT 
EXAMPLE:
PREPARE BATTLE DICE
Yellow is rolling 2 dice to 
attack since he has sent 2 
battalions in. Red is 
defending with 2 battalions 
so she will also roll 2 dice. 
NOTE: Red does not roll a 
die for her Leader. She will, 
however, be able to add a +1 
bonus to her higher die roll.
COMBAT 
EXAMPLE:
RESOLVE COMBAT
Yellow (the attacker) rolls a 4 
and a 2. Red (the defender) 
rolls a 3 and a 1. First, the 
players compare their highest 
dice: Yellow 4 and Red 3, but 
Red has sent a Leader into 
combat and gets to add +1 to 
her higher defense die. This 
brings her roll up to a 4 also. 
Since defenders win ties, Red 
defeats Yellow and he removes 
1 of his attacking battalions 
from the battleground. Now, 
the players compare their 
next-highest dice: Yellow 2 
and Red 1. This time Yellow 
defeats Red because his die 
roll is higher than Red’s. Red 
removes 1 of her defending 
battalions from the 
battleground. Remember: The 
Leader bonus is only added 
to the player’s highest die roll.

After you and your opponent compare the highest dice, 
compare the next-highest dice.
If there is no die to compare yours to, meaning you rolled 1 or 2 
more dice than your opponent, then ignore those dice rolls.
When the battle is over, all remaining battalions return to their 
respective territories – but don’t worry, you may send them back 
into battle immediately.
Calling off an invaSion
After any battle, you (the attacker) may choose to call off the 
invasion. You may choose to invade a new territory, invade a 
territory you attacked earlier during combat, or end the combat 
part of your turn.
Changing the attaCking territory during an invaSion
In between battles, you can change the territory from which you 
are invading and continue the invasion from a different, adjacent 
territory. What you cannot do is battle with battalions from 
different territories at the same time. During one battle, all of 
your battalions must be from the same territory.
winning an invaSion and Moving in
You win the invasion when you defeat the last defending 
battalion from a territory. Take the battalions used to win the 
battle and move them from the battleground into the territory 
you invaded. You may now move any additional battalions from 
your invading territory in to join them. So even though you can 
only battle with 3 battalions, once you’ve won the invasion, you 
can move more troops into your new territory. However, you 
must do this before you declare a new invasion.
LEADERS 
If a Leader is used in combat when conquering a territory, then 
you must move the Leader into that territory at the end of that 
combat.
If the last battalion in a territory with a Leader is defeated,  
the Leader is also defeated and must be removed from the board.
finiShing a MiSSion
If, during your turn, one of your Leaders moves into (or is 
already in) a Site of Power listed on one of your Mission cards, 
you may declare that mission complete by turning in the 
Mission card and collecting its reward.
COMBAT 
EXAMPLE:
YELLOW ATTACKS FROM  
A NEW TERRITORY
Yellow has only 2 battalions 
left in Evendim Hills, but has 
10 battalions in Lune Valley, 
which is also adjacent to 
Borderlands. Yellow 
continues the invasion from 
Lune Valley and sends 3 
battalions out to invade 
Borderlands. Red defends 
with 2 more battalions and 
her Leader.
Yellow rolls 3 dice (1 for each 
attacking battalion), and gets 
a 6, a 4 and a 4. Red defends 
with two 4s. Yellow’s highest 
die is a 6 and Red’s highest 
die is a 4. Red adds her 
Leader bonus, which brings 
her highest die roll to 5. 
Since 6 is higher than 5, Red 
loses a defending battalion 
and removes it from the 
battleground. Yellow’s  
next-highest die is a 4 and 
Red’s next-highest die is also 
a 4. Since this is a tie (and 
defenders win ties) Red wins 
and Yellow loses an attacking 
battalion and removes it 
from the battleground. 
Yellow’s last die roll, a 4, is 
not used since there is no 
defending die to compare  
it to.
eliMinating another Player
You eliminate another player if you defeat his/her last 
battalion on the board. This player is now out of the game. As a 
reward, you get all of that player’s Territory cards (if he/she has 
any). Add these Territory cards to your hand. You DO NOT get 
the player’s Adventure cards. They are immediately placed in 
the discard pile, whether they have been played or not.
If your new hand of Territory cards is now 5 or more, you must 
stop and immediately turn a set in for bonus reinforcements. You 
place these reinforcements into any of your territories. If you 
still have 5 or more cards, then turn in another set and place 
these reinforcements as well. Finally, when you have 4 or fewer 
cards, continue your turn.
adventure CardS
You may play as many Adventure cards during your turn as you 
want or are able to.
Mission cards are completed by getting a Leader to the Site of 
Power listed on the card. You may have to conquer the territory, 
or may already control it and just have to move your Leader 
there. Some missions have different rewards for good or evil 
players. Keep completed Mission cards in front of you, as you 
will score points for them at the end of the game.
Power cards will help you during the Combat phase of your 
turn or, in some cases, during other players’ turns. Keep played 
Power cards in front of you, as you will score points for them at 
the end of the game.
SteP 3: fortify your PoSition
After you are finished with combat (and it is your choice when 
you are done), you get ONE fortification (or "free move") with 
your battalions.
To fortify your position, take as many battalions as you’d 
like from one of your territories and move them to another 
connected territory. (Remember: You MUST leave at least one 
battalion behind  -- you cannot abandon a territory.)
Territories are "connected" if all the territories in between 
are also CONTROLLED BY YOU. You cannot pass through 
territories controlled by another player.
COMBAT 
EXAMPLE:
YELLOW WINS THE 
INVASION AND CLAIMS 
BORDERLANDS
Red has only 1 defending 
battalion left in Borderlands, 
so Yellow attacks again from 
Lune Valley. Yellow moves 3 
battalions from Lune Valley 
onto the battleground to 
attack Borderlands. Red 
moves her 1 battalion and 
Leader onto the 
battleground to defend 
Borderlands. Yellow wins the 
battle and the invasion. Red 
removes her battalion and 
her Leader from the 
battleground. Yellow moves 
his 3 attacking battalions 
into Borderlands to claim the 
territory, then he moves 5 of 
the 6 remaining battalions 
from Lune Valley into 
Borderlands, leaving 1 behind.
EXAMPLE
At the end of your turn, 
you can fortify from your 
newly acquired territory, 
Borderlands, through Lune 
Valley, through Mithlond, 
and into Forlindon since 
you control all these 
territories. Since you only 
went through your own 
territories, Borderlands and 
Forlindon are "connected."

Fortification is not an attack; it is simply a movement from one 
of your territories to another in order to protect your front line 
or to get into position for your next turn.
leaderS 
Your Leader can be moved through a Territory containing 
your other Leader, he just can’t end up in the same territory.  
If you use a Leader to fortify one of the Sites of Power listed 
on one of your Mission cards, you can claim the mission 
immediately.
SteP 4: ColleCt a territory Card
At the end of your turn, you may be able to collect a 
Territory card.
If you conquered at least 1 territory on your turn, then you 
get 1 Territory card. Draw it off the top of the deck and add 
it to your hand. It doesn’t matter whether you conquered 1 
territory or 40 territories, you only get 1 Territory card. If 
you didn’t conquer any territories on your turn, then you 
do not get a Territory card.
SteP 5: ColleCt an adventure Card
If, on your turn, one of your Leaders conquered a territory 
containing a Site of Power, you get to draw 1 card off the top 
of the Adventure card deck.
If the card you draw is an Event card (it reads "Play 
Immediately"), then play the card immediately. After playing it, 
draw another card. Continue to play any drawn Event cards until 
you draw a Mission or Power card.
When you do draw a Mission or Power card, add it to your 
hand. If this causes you to have more than 4 Adventure cards 
in hand, discard one (of your choice). It doesn’t matter whether 
your Leader conquered 1 Site of Power or several, you only get 1 
Adventure card.
After a MiSSion or Power card has been drawn, no more 
cards can be played on your turn.
SteP 6: rePlaCe a leader
If you have no Leaders in play, place one Leader into any of 
your territories.
SteP 7: Move the fellowShiP
The Fellowship, represented by The One Ring, starts in the Shire. 
At the end of each player’s turn, move it into the next territory 
along the Fellowship’s dotted path. When it is in a territory with a 
DIE symbol, you must roll the die before moving it. A roll greater 
than 3 will move the Fellowship into the next territory along its 
path. If the roll is 3 or less, the Fellowship remains in its current 
territory. The next player will try again. The Fellowship will remain 
in this territory until a successful die roll is made.
WINNING
When the Fellowship reaches Mount Doom, a final die roll must 
be made to destroy The One Ring. A roll greater than 3 means 
The One Ring was thrown into Mount Doom and destroyed. This 
ends the game. The player with the highest number of points wins!
A die roll of 3 or less means the Fellowship has not yet destroyed 
The One Ring. The game continues with each player, at the end of 
his/her turn, rolling to destroy The One Ring, until a successful 
die roll is made.
SCORING POINTS
Calculate points as follows:
*  1 point for every territory you control;
*  2 points for every stronghold you control;
*  Points for Adventure cards you played (as indicated at the
bottom of the card). Cards in your hand do not count;
*  Points for complete regions held, equal to the battalion bonus
of that region (for example, Mirkwood is worth 4 points since  
is gives you 4 battalions for controlling it).

ALLIANCE RISK
FOR 4 PLAYERS
Gameplay for Alliance RISK is the same as the 3- to 4-Player 
Individual game with the following exceptions:
The two good armies play as a team and the two evil armies 
play as a team. Players, although on the same team, play 
separately. They cannot give each other territories, fortify 
through each other’s territories, or share cards.
The winning player is the one with the higher score on the team 
with the higher score.
At the end of the game, first add up the points for each team 
(good and evil). Then determine which player, on the higher 
scoring team, has more points. That player wins.
It is possible in this version for the player with the highest score 
not to win if his/her teammate does very poorly.
TEAM RISK
FOR 4 PLAYERS
Gameplay for Team RISK is the same as the 3 to 4-Player 
Individual game with the following exceptions:
In this game, players do not win individually, but instead win as 
a team. Points do not matter in this version. Players, although 
on the same team, play separately. They cannot give each other 
territories, fortify through each other’s territories, or share cards.
SETUP
The evil player who controls more strongholds in Mordor 
places last and goes last. The person to his/her left places 
first and goes first.
WINNING
Good wins if one of the following happens:
* Both evil players are eliminated, OR
*  The One Ring is thrown into Mount Doom.
Evil wins if one of the following happens:
* Both good players are eliminated, OR
* The One Ring is found by an evil player (how you
find The One Ring is explained on the back).
Note: It is possible, but unlikely, to win by conquering all of 
Middle-earth before the Fellowship throws The One Ring into 
Mount Doom.
OTHER WAYS TO PLAY
THE 2-PLAYER GAME
Gameplay for the 2-Player version is the same as the 3- to 
4-Player Individual game with the following exceptions:
When playing with only 2 players, one must play a good army 
and the other must play an evil army. A third, neutral army (one 
of the two unused colors) also comes into play.
*  Remove the wild cards from the Territory Deck. Separate the
remaining cards into a good, an evil and a neutral deck. Shuffle 
each deck and deal them to the players as shown below.
GOOD PLAYER – 16 Good
EVIL PLAYER – 16 Evil
NEUTRAL ARMY – 21 Neutral
* Each player places 1 battalion into each of his/her territories.
Each neutral territory gets 2 battalions of the neutral’s color 
(for a total of 42 neutral battalions).
* Roll a die to see who starts; the player with the higher roll
begins. In turn, place 1 battalion into an unclaimed territory 
until each territory on the board has battalions in it. Players 
then alternate placing their battalions into territories they 
already control until all 60 of their starting battalions are on 
the board.
* The neutral army acts as opposition with the following restrictions: 
     •  The neutral army cannot attack or redeploy.
     •  In battle, the neutral army only defends. The second player
rolls the defending (black) dice for the neutral army.
     •  The neutral army receives no Leader or Adventure cards.
     •  The Fellowship, represented by The One Ring, is not moved
by the neutral army.
STANDARD RISK
You can play standard RISK on the RISK: The Lord of the Rings 
Edition gameboard. Simply follow all the rules in black, ignoring 
the rules in blue. The game will continue until one player 
controls the entire board.

FINDING THE RING
There is one extra step to your turn. This is where the evil player 
may try to find The One Ring.
THE 8 STEPS TO YOUR TURN
1. Receive and place Reinforcements (always)
2. Combat (If you like)
3. Fortify your position (if you like)
4. Collect a Territory card (as long as you have conquered a
territory)
5. Collect an Adventrue card (as long as your Leader has
conquered a territory that has a Site of Power within it)
6. Replace a Leader (if you have none on the board)
7. Try to find The One Ring (only if The One Ring is in a
territory controlled by an evil player)
8. Move the Fellowship
SteP 7: try to find the one ring
Just before moving the Fellowship, check to see if The One Ring is 
in a territory controlled by evil. If so, the evil player who controls 
the territory rolls 2 dice (it doesn’t matter which color).
*  If that evil player controls the entire region, add 1 to the dice roll.
*  If that evil player’s Leader is in the territory, add 1 to the dice roll.
*  If that evil player controls the entire region, and has a Leader
present, add 2 to the dice roll.
If the total of the dice roll plus any bonuses added is 12 or higher, 
The One Ring is found and evil instantly wins.
