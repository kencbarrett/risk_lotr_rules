        These territories are grouped into 9 regions, each a  <br>different color:<br>REGION <br>COLOR  <br>NO.

Territories are <br>adjacent if they share a border, or a sea-line connects them <br>across water.<br>EXAMPLE: <br> <br>The territory of Minhiriath is <br>adjacent to South Downs because <br>they share a border, and to <br>Enedwaith and Dunland because <br>bridges allow passage across the <br>separating river. Minhiriath is also <br>adjacent to Mithlond, Belfalas and <br>Umbar because sea-lines connect <br>them across the ocean. Battalions in <br>Minhiriath can attack any of these <br>adjacent territories. But beware, the <br>battalions in Minhiriath can also BE <br>attacked from any of these <br>territories. Minhiriath is not <br>adjacent to Harlindon or the Shire <br>because a river separates them and <br>there are no bridges to pass over. <br>INTRODUCTION<br>Many, many years ago, The One Ring was forged by the Dark <br>Lord Sauron to control all of Middle-earth. Naturally, its awesome <br>strength is much desired by those who wish for power. For a long <br>time, its whereabouts remained secret, but recently its power has <br>been sensed again in the land of its creation. The forces of evil are <br>mounting a ferocious hunt to find The One Ring, while those of a <br>gentler nature are keen to keep it from their reach. <br>This special edition of RISK allows you to decide the fate of the <br>people of Middle-earth. You will play either a good force or an <br>evil force trying to gain control of the land. Muster your forces <br>to battle to ensure that Middle-earth falls into the right hands.<br>You may also choose to use the RISK: The Lord of the Rings <br>Edition gameboard to play standard RISK, by leaving out the <br>special elements.<br>The following rules are for the individual player game. There are <br>additional versions explained in the back of this rulebook.<br>A LOOK AT THE STUFF  <br>IN THE GAME<br>First, take all of the game pieces and set them out where you can <br>see them. As you read these rules, look at these pieces so you <br>know how they all work.<br>LET’S START WITH THE GAMEBOARD… <br>There it is – Middle-earth, just waiting for you to conquer it. The <br>gameboard is divided into 64 territories, each with its own name.<br>In the lower left corner of the gameboard, there is a <br>battleground. This is where your battles will take place. <br>We will discuss this in more detail soon.<br> <br>NOW LET’S LOOK AT THE  <br>PLASTIC PIECES…<br>There are 4 armies in this game, each a different color. Each <br>player will be a different colored army. <br>If you look at the pieces closely, you’ll see that there are 6 <br>different shapes: 3 for good and 3 for evil. All of these pieces <br>represent your battalions, but each one represents a different <br>number of battalions. They are:<br>FORCES OF GOOD<br>FORCES OF EVIL<br>During the game, you will have many pieces on the board, <br>sometimes many in one territory. When this happens, use a larger <br>piece to save space. It’s a lot easier to have 2 Eagles on the board <br>instead of 10 Elven Archers (both equal 10 battalions). Just like <br>it’s easier to carry 2 nickels instead of 10 pennies, it’s easier to <br>move 2 Cavetrolls instead of 10 Orcs. <br>EXAMPLE: <br>In Minhiriath, Green has 1 Rider of Rohan and 2 <br>Elven Archers. Since a Rider of Rohan represents 3 battalions and an <br>Elven Archer represents 1 battalion, the Green player has 5 battalions in <br>Minhiriath (3+1+1). The Red player has 1 Cavetroll, 1 Dark Rider and  <br>1 Orc in Enedwaith. This represents 9 battalions (5+3+1).<br>THE DICE<br>Use the dice when attacking and defending territories.  <br>The 3 red dice are used when attacking. The 2 black dice  <br>are used when defending.<br>THE CARDS<br>Elven Archer  <br>1 battalion<br>Rider of Rohan <br>3 battalions<br>Eagle  <br>5 battalions<br>Orc  <br>1 battalion<br>Dark Rider  <br>3 battalions<br> Cavetroll <br>  5 battalions <br> evil <br>good<br>territory CardS<br>There is 1 Territory card for each of the 64 territories on the <br>board. <br> There are also 2 wild <br>cards that don’t have territories or good/evil symbols on them <br>but do have pictures of the 3 battalion types.<br>Territory cards are used to determine positions at the start of <br>the game, and bonus reinforcements throughout the game. We’ll <br>explain how they work a little later.<br>GETTING STARTED<br>1.  Set out the gameboard so everyone can reach it.<br>MISSION CARD<br>EVENT CARD<br>POWER CARD<br>4.  Each player chooses a color and takes all of the battalions of <br>that color. Place your battalions in a pile near you. <br>Now get out your starting battalions. These battalions will be <br>placed on the board before play begins. The number of starting <br>battalions depends on the number of players.<br> # <br>of<br> P<br>layerS<br> <br>S<br>tarting<br> b<br>attalionS<br> 2 <br>PlayerS<br> <br>60 <br>eaCh<br> (S<br>ee<br> 2-<br>Player<br> <br>ruleS<br> <br>on<br> <br>Page<br> 18.)<br> 3 <br>PlayerS<br> <br>52 <br>eaCh<br> 4 <br>PlayerS<br> <br>45 <br>eaCh<br>Count out your starting battalions from your battalion pile, <br>and put them in front of you. <br>CLAIMING TERRITORIES<br>Now, each player rolls 1 die to see who goes first – the high die <br>roll wins. Play then passes to the left.<br>To claim an additional territory, take one of your starting <br>battalions and place it into an empty territory. You now control <br>this territory. The next player places a battalion into an empty <br>territory, claiming that territory, and so on. You cannot put a <br>battalion into a territory that has already been claimed.<br>Eventually, all 64 territories will be claimed. Some players may <br>control one more territory than the other players.  This is OK. <br>© NLP™ Middle-earth Ent. Lic. to New Line. (s21). <br>© 2021 Hasbro.<br>TM<br>© NLP™ Middle-earth Ent. Lic. to New Line. (s21). <br>© 2021 Hasbro.<br>i<br>MPortant<br>:<br> From now on, there will be no unclaimed territories <br>on the board. Control of a territory (the player who has <br>battalions there) may change, but a territory will never be <br>unclaimed.<br>REINFORCING TERRITORIES<br>Now that all of the territories are claimed, you will start <br>reinforcing your territories. The more battalions you have in a <br>territory, the easier it is to attack and defend from.  <br>Reinforcing a territory is simple: just place one of your starting <br>battalions into a territory that you control. You cannot place <br>reinforcements into an enemy’s territory. After you place your <br>reinforcement, the player to your left reinforces one territory, then <br>the next player to the left, and so on. Keep going around the table <br>until all of each player’s starting battalions have been placed.<br>There is no limit to the number of battalions that can be in a <br>territory. You can choose to reinforce one territory with a large <br>number of battalions or you can spread your battalions out <br>across all of your territories. <br>Now it’s time to declare war. Each player rolls 1 die to see who <br>starts the game. Note: The player who placed his/her battalions <br>first may or may not be the player who takes the first turn.<br>YOUR TURN<br>OVERVIEW<br>At the start of each one of your turns, you will receive <br>additional battalions, which you will place on the board to <br>reinforce your army. Then you will be able to attack your <br>enemies, if you want. After you are done with combat, you <br>will get one chance to relocate some of your battalions. If you <br>conquer a territory on your turn, you get to draw a Territory <br>card. <br>That’s all there is to a turn. Now let’s go over things in more <br>detail so you can plan your conquest. <br>THE 7 STEPS OF YOUR TURN<br>You must do these steps in order.<br>1. Receive and place reinforcements (always).<br>2. Combat (if you like).<br>3. Fortify your position (if you like).<br>4.  Collect a territory card (as long as you have conquered  <br>a territory).<br>S<br>teP<br> 1: r<br>eCeive<br> <br>and<br> P<br>laCe<br> r<br>einforCeMentS<br>At the start of your turn, you get additional battalions to <br>reinforce your territories. How many reinforcements you get <br>depends on<br>, the number <br>of territories you control, the number of regions you control (if <br>any), and any Territory card sets you turn in.<br>C<br>ount<br> y<br>our<br> t<br>erritorieS<br>:<br> Now count the number of territories <br>you control (these are the territories with your battalions in <br>them). Take your total number of territories and divide them by <br>3 (ignore any remainders). This is the number of reinforcements <br>you receive. However, the number of reinforcements you receive <br>can NEVER be fewer than 3, so even if you control only a few <br>territories, you’ll always receive at least 3 reinforcements.  <br>Take your reinforcements from your battalion pile and put them <br>in front of you. This is the start of your "reinforcement pile."<br>Look at the list below to help you determine your reinforcements.<br>    territorieS                       reinforCeMentS<br>  <br>1-11 <br>3<br>  <br>12-14 <br>4<br>  <br>15-17 <br>5<br>  <br>18-20 <br>6<br>  <br>21-23 <br>7<br>  <br>24-26 <br>8<br>  <br>27-29 <br>9<br>  <br>30-32 <br>10<br>  <br>33-35 <br>11<br>  <br>36-38 <br>12<br>  <br>39-41 <br>13<br>  <br>42-44 <br>14<br>  <br>45-47 <br>15<br>  <br>48-50 <br>16<br>  <br>51-53 <br>17<br>  <br>54-56 <br>18<br>  <br>57-59 <br>19<br>  <br>60-62 <br>20<br>  <br>63 <br>21 <br>d<br>o<br> y<br>ou<br> C<br>ontrol<br> a<br>ny<br> r<br>egionS<br>?<br> You also get reinforcements for <br>every region you control. Remember that a region is a group <br>of territories of the same color. If you control every territory <br>within the region, then you control the region. <br>The number of reinforcements you receive depends on  <br>which region (or regions) you control (if any). The chart <br>on the left side of the gameboard shows how many <br>reinforcements you receive for each region. Count out these <br>reinforcements from your battalion pile and add them to the <br>reinforcement pile in front of you (the pile you started by <br>counting your territories).<br>t<br>urn<br> <br>in<br> a<br>ny<br> C<br>ard<br> S<br>etS<br> y<br>ou<br> M<br>ay<br> h<br>ave<br>:<br> This may seem a little <br>out of place because we haven’t talked about how you get <br>Territory cards yet (we’ll talk about that more in Step 4), but <br>this is the time when you would turn in Territory cards for <br>bonus reinforcements.<br>Remember how each Territory card has an image at the bottom <br>– an Elven Archer, a Dark Rider or an Eagle (the wild cards have <br>all 3)? When you have a set of 3 cards that show either the <br>same picture or one of each picture, you can turn them in for <br>reinforcements. If you have a wild card, it can count as any one of <br>the 3 – an Elven Archer, a Dark Rider or an Eagle.<br> <br>n<br>ow<br> i<br>t<br>’<br>S<br> t<br>iMe<br> <br>to<br> P<br>laCe<br> y<br>our<br> r<br>einforCeMentS<br>:<br> After gathering <br>your reinforcements, place ALL of them into territories that <br>you control. You can choose to put all of your reinforcements <br>into one territory or spread them out across your territories. <br>Remember: You must place ALL of these reinforcements.<br>S<br>teP<br> 2: C<br>oMbat<br>Combat is the main part of your turn. It is here that you attack <br>your opponents and attempt to take territories from them. You <br>can choose how many times you want to attack, in what order, <br>and when to call it off. You can choose not to attack at all (if so, <br>skip to Step 3) or to attack until you have almost no battalions <br>left. You can even attack more than one territory on your turn. <br>a f<br>ew<br> w<br>ordS<br> <br>about<br> C<br>oMbat<br>Here are some terms used during combat:<br>* The <br>attaCker<br> is the player whose turn it currently is.<br>* The <br>defender<br> is the player being attacked.<br>* An<br> <br>invaSion<br> is when a territory is being attacked. The <br>invasion lasts until either the territory is taken over or <br>until the attacker calls off the invasion. You may be able <br>to invade more than one territory on your turn.<br>* A <br>battle<br> is one roll of the dice (for each, the attacker and <br>defender) during an invasion. An invasion may require <br>one battle or it may require dozens of battles.<br>w<br>here<br> C<br>an<br> i i<br>nvade<br>?<br>You can invade from any one territory you control into an <br>adjacent enemy’s territory. <br> You can only invade an <br>enemy’s territories – not your own. Choose a territory you <br>control and announce the adjacent territory you wish to invade.<br>h<br>ow<br> y<br>ou<br> b<br>attle<br>You must have at least 2 battalions in a territory in order to <br>attack. This is because 1 battalion must stay behind in order to <br>protect the territory you are invading from. This battalion must <br>be set aside and cannot be part of any battle. <br>Now choose how many battalions you will send from your <br>attacking territory into the battle. You can send 1, 2 or 3 <br>battalions. Your invasion force may be much larger than 3, <br>but no more than 3 battalions can be sent into each battle. <br>Take your attacking battalions and place them on the <br>attacker’s spaces on the battleground (in the lower left <br>corner of the gameboard).<br>Next, the defender chooses how many battalions will defend <br>from the attacked territory. You can defend with either 1 or 2 <br>battalions. There may be more battalions in the territory, but 2 is <br>the maximum number of battalions you can defend with during <br>a battle. You will continue defending the attacked territory until <br>either your last battalion is defeated or your opponent calls off <br>the invasion. <br>Take your defending battalions and place them on the defender’s <br>spaces on the battleground.<br>Let the battle begin… Each side rolls 1 die for each battalion <br>attacking or defending. This means the attacker will roll 1, 2 or 3 <br>dice and the defender will roll 1 or 2 dice. <br>r<br>eSolving<br> <br>the<br> b<br>attle<br>After both sides roll the dice, put your dice in order from <br>highest to lowest. You will then compare your highest die to <br>your opponent’s highest die to see who won. IMPORTANT: In <br>case of a tie roll, the DEFENDER wins. <br>The player with the highest die roll wins. The loser removes <br>a battalion from the battleground. This battalion has been <br>defeated. Put the defeated battalion back into its respective <br>battalion pile off the board. <br>After you and your opponent compare the highest dice, <br>compare the next-highest dice. <br>If there is no die to compare yours to, meaning you rolled 1 or 2 <br>more dice than your opponent, then ignore those dice rolls.<br>When the battle is over, all remaining battalions return to their <br>respective territories – but don’t worry, you may send them back <br>into battle immediately.<br>C<br>alling<br> o<br>ff<br> <br>an<br> i<br>nvaSion<br>After any battle, you (the attacker) may choose to call off the <br>invasion. You may choose to invade a new territory, invade a <br>territory you attacked earlier during combat, or end the combat <br>part of your turn. <br>C<br>hanging<br> <br>the<br> a<br>ttaCking<br> t<br>erritory<br> d<br>uring<br> <br>an<br> i<br>nvaSion<br>In between battles, you can change the territory from which you <br>are invading and continue the invasion from a different, adjacent <br>territory. What you cannot do is battle with battalions from <br>different territories at the same time. During one battle, all of <br>your battalions must be from the same territory.<br>w<br>inning<br> <br>an<br> i<br>nvaSion<br> <br>and<br> M<br>oving<br> i<br>n<br>You win the invasion when you defeat the last defending <br>battalion from a territory. Take the battalions used to win the <br>battle and move them from the battleground into the territory <br>you invaded. You may now move any additional battalions from <br>your invading territory in to join them. So even though you can <br>only battle with 3 battalions, once you’ve won the invasion, you <br>can move more troops into your new territory. However, you <br>must do this before you declare a new invasion.<br>e<br>liMinating<br> a<br>nother<br> P<br>layer<br>You eliminate another player if you defeat his/her last <br>battalion on the board. This player is now out of the game. As a <br>reward, you get all of that player’s Territory cards (if he/she has <br>any). Add these Territory cards to your hand. <br> <br>If your new hand of Territory cards is now 5 or more, you must <br>stop and immediately turn a set in for bonus reinforcements. You <br>place these reinforcements into any of your territories. If you <br>still have 5 or more cards, then turn in another set and place <br>these reinforcements as well. Finally, when you have 4 or fewer <br>cards, continue your turn.<br>S<br>teP<br> 3: f<br>ortify<br> y<br>our<br> P<br>oSition<br>After you are finished with combat (and it is your choice when <br>you are done), you get ONE fortification (or "free move") with <br>your battalions. <br>To fortify your position, take as many battalions as you’d <br>like from one of your territories and move them to another <br>connected territory. (Remember: You MUST leave at least one <br>battalion behind  -- you cannot abandon a territory.) <br>Territories are "connected" if all the territories in between <br>are also CONTROLLED BY YOU. You cannot pass through <br>territories controlled by another player.  <br>Fortification is not an attack; it is simply a movement from one <br>of your territories to another in order to protect your front line <br>or to get into position for your next turn.<br>S<br>teP<br> 4: C<br>olleCt<br> <br>a<br> t<br>erritory<br> C<br>ard<br>At the end of your turn, you may be able to collect a <br>Territory card. <br>If you conquered at least 1 territory on your turn, then you <br>get 1 Territory card. Draw it off the top of the deck and add <br>it to your hand. It doesn’t matter whether you conquered 1 <br>territory or 40 territories, you only get 1 Territory card. If <br>you didn’t conquer any territories on your turn, then you <br>do not get a Territory card.<br>OTHER WAYS TO PLAY<br>STANDARD RISK<br>You can play standard RISK on the RISK: The Lord of the Rings <br>Edition gameboard.
